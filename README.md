Main file of interest at this point is CK_MA_pair1.Rmd, which contains the Rmd for pair assignment 1.

MCAgosta.R contains Marie's separate script, which is dynamically linked to CK_MA_pair1.Rmd.

The first part of the assignment examines FiveThirtyEight data that came from a survey of drug use 
in the U.S. Using simply descriptive statistics it makes some observations. For instance: as you age you're less likely to be a marijuana user, but if you do remain a user into your 30s you're likely to smoke as much as young people or even more. But obviously this idea would have to be tested for statistical significance. 

The second part uses core R data. It searches through the core R and downloads UKLungDeaths. It is cmprised of three time-series objects: both sexes (ldeaths), males (mdeaths) and females (fdeaths).
It shows monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in the UK, 1974–1979

Then proceeded to perform basic descriptive stats to get a better idea  of the trends of the avilable data, plotted each time-series and then plotted male and female together to see the correlation. 

The range showed the disparity in range from male to female deaths  and the summary stats reinforced this. Male numbers are  all together higher.  Both groups are strongly correlated , which is expected given what they are measuring and the time frame.
